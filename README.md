# Ensemble_Machine_Learning_Python
This is a note of myself learning ensemble method.

## Bias-Varinance Trade Off
1. Usually our goal in machine learning is to lower the variance and the bias.
2. However, in only a single model, there's a trade-off in bias and variance.
3. Thus, maybe using ensemble method can solve this problem.
